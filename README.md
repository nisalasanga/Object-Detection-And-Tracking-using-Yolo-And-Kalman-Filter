# Object-Tracking-using-Yolo-And-Sort

This project presents an investigation into the application of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm for multi-object tracking in computer vision.
The project report describes the integration of YOLOv8 object detection model with the SORT algorithm which use Kalman Filtering for object tracking. The algorithmâ€™s 
performance is evaluated based on tracking accuracy, speed, and stability, and the findings are discussed in the context of object tracking.
